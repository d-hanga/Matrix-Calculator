- blur alerts instead of normal site-alerts (everything blurs, red text pops up e.g.)
- export/import
- make name changable but then also !!!pay attention for the key!!!
- create placeholders for drop down fields => pay attention for the setting of the states
- add keys to dropdowfields ????? (maybe only for names bc they can change)
- make drop down fields ... (frogot what i wanted to do)
- value prop for select fields?????
- key doesn't work
- create form around buttons
- add alert after editing if not already
- make dropdownboxes be able to type into
- in the calculation breaker: just check if I and T are included, and then just do both in any reihenfolge, so you dont have to check 4 cases, but just 2 (=> check if A.T^(-1) = A^(-1).T)
  => then only check if T and I are on the end
- whereever statechange and passing happens: dont pass anymore, instead write normal code which is executed when any change happens
- add when doing this to a matrix: 1x3 => 1x1 => 1x3 the last data still remains => matrix stays intact
- control tabs

x when tapping on one matrix, everything blures, it comes forward (centered + middle) in edit mode



fix:
"""
One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.
