- dont make grid, copy the css from the image-query-searcher with matrices
- in app, targeting is used => change that!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- blur alerts instead of normal site-alerts (everything blurs, red text pops up e.g.)
- value prop for select fields?????
- create form around buttons
- add alert after editing if not already
- make dropdownboxes be able to type into
- whereever statechange and passing happens: dont pass anymore, instead write normal code which is executed when any change happens
- control tabs
- do this: name + matrix and when it overflows keep it there above the matrix-scrolling thing +++ name should be closer, which now doesnt happen, bc the dimeensions take too much place and its like this <name> + (<dimensions> + <matrix>)
- add export/import feature of the matrices
- replace public files with own

x when tapping on one matrix, everything blures, it comes forward (centered + middle) in edit mode



fix:
"""
One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.
