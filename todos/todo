- create alert for too big matrices
- value prop for select fields?????
- create form around buttons
- replace public files with own
- create efunctions in the most child component possible
- whenever this happens:
    () => {changeState, do1, do...}
  change to
    () => changeState;
    if (state) {
        do1;
        do...
    }
- add scalars

fix:
"""
One of your dependencies, babel-preset-react-app, is importing the
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" package without
declaring it in its dependencies. This is currently working because
"@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" is already in your
node_modules folder for unrelated reasons, but it may break at any time.

babel-preset-react-app is part of the create-react-app project, which
is not maintianed anymore. It is thus unlikely that this bug will
ever be fixed. Add "@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object" to
your devDependencies to work around this error. This will make this message
go away.
